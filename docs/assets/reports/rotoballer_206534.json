{"title": "Ashton Jeanty Salvages his Day With Receiving Touchdown in Week 9", "description": "Las Vegas Raiders rookie first-round running back Ashton Jeanty had another mediocre performance on the ground in the team's Week 9 overtime loss to the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, but he salvaged his day for fantasy managers by catching all five of his targets for 47 yards and a touchdown through the air. On the ground, Jeanty handled a team-high 13 carries for 42 yards (3.2 yards per carry). The 21-year-old was able to bounce back coming out of the bye week after he had a season-low six carries for 21 yards and only one catch for 13 yards in the Week 7 blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. It's been slow going for Jeanty the last three games behind a shaky Raiders offensive line, and things won't get any easier on a short week on Thursday Night Football against a stout Denver Broncos defense in Week 10. Through his first eight NFL games, Jeanty has three rushing scores and three receiving touchdowns.", "player_name": "Ashton Jeanty", "week": 10, "team": "LV", "opp": "DEN", "att": 19, "tgt": 5, "touches": 24, "actual": "high", "expect": "low", "reason": "opponent", "rushing_touchdowns": 1, "receiving_touchdowns": 0, "ppr_scoring_fantasy_points": 15, "ppr_scoring_position_rank": 14}
