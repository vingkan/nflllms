{"title": "Bam Knight Considered Questionable for Week 11", "description": "Arizona Cardinals running back Bam Knight (ankle) was limited in practice all week and is listed as questionable to play on Sunday against the division-rival San Francisco 49ers in Week 11. Knight was once again the team's starting RB in last weekend's blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks, with Trey Benson (knee) still on Injured Reserve, but now his status is up in the air. The 24-year-old should be able to suit up, but his ankle injury could open the door for both Emari Demercado and Michael Carter to see more backfield touches. Knight had only 33 scrimmage yards on 11 touches before his ankle injury in Week 10, and he hasn't been very efficient since taking over in Arizona. Even when healthy, Knight's RB1 role hasn't been very secure, with Demercado seeing 14 carries in Week 9. If Knight is active, he'll be a pretty wishy-washy RB3/flex with limited upside for fantasy managers.", "player_name": "Zonovan Knight", "week": 11, "team": "ARI", "opp": "SF", "att": 5, "tgt": 4, "touches": 9, "actual": "low", "expect": "low", "reason": "injury", "rushing_touchdowns": 1, "receiving_touchdowns": 0, "ppr_scoring_fantasy_points": 14, "ppr_scoring_position_rank": 18}
