{"title": "Rico Dowdle in Line For an Increased Workload in Week 5", "description": "Carolina Panthers running back and former Dallas Cowboy, Rico Dowdle, is set to be the lead back in the Panthers' backfield in Week 5 against the Miami Dolphins, with Chuba Hubbard (calf) ruled out for Week 5. Hubbard is considered week-to-week, so Dowdle isn't expected to be a hot commodity for a season-long play, but he immediately rises in the Week 5 ranks and becomes a top-25 running back against the Dolphins defense, which allows the seventh most fantasy points to the running back position. Dowdle is no slouch either; last year with the Cowboys, he accumulated 1,328 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns. Rookie running back Trevor Etienne becomes the team's RB2 and should also be in line for additional carries.", "player_name": "Rico Dowdle", "week": 5, "team": "CAR", "opp": "MIA", "att": 23, "tgt": 4, "touches": 27, "actual": "high", "expect": "high", "reason": "injury", "rushing_touchdowns": 1, "receiving_touchdowns": 0, "ppr_scoring_fantasy_points": 32, "ppr_scoring_position_rank": 1}
