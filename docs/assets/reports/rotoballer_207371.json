{"title": "Sloppy Offense Leads To Reduced Touches For Aaron Jones Sr., Jordan Mason", "description": "Minnesota Vikings running backs Aaron Jones Sr. and Jordan Mason combined for only 13 carries in the team's Week 10 loss to Baltimore, but the running game was hindered by a significant number of presnap penalties. Minnesota committed a whopping eight false start penalties -- the most by a team since 2011 -- including five of them on first-and-10 situations, and also committed three turnovers. Both Jones and Mason were above five years per carry, but Minnesota found itself in so many poor down-and-distance situations that it attempted 42 passes. \"When you average six yards a play on offense, it's all for naught if you're going to be giving back so many of those yards in different capacities,\" Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell said. It was a frustrating day for managers who started Jones or Mason, but an aberrational amount of penalties suggests Minnesota's top two running backs were not the problem with the rushing attack.", "player_name": "Aaron Jones", "week": 11, "team": "MIN", "opp": "CHI", "att": 16, "tgt": 6, "touches": 22, "actual": "high", "expect": "unknown", "reason": "unknown", "rushing_touchdowns": 0, "receiving_touchdowns": 0, "ppr_scoring_fantasy_points": 11, "ppr_scoring_position_rank": 22}
