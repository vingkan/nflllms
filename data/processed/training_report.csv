rotoballer_203422,RB,Zavier Scott,5,MIN,CLE,11299,202510508,2025,2025-10-05 08:30 AM,2025-10-03 03:42 PM,Zavier Scott A High-Risk Bet After Breakout Game,"Following his best game in the NFL, Minnesota Vikings running back Zavier Scott is a risky RB4/Flex option heading into a matchup against the Cleveland Browns. The former Maine standout is a converted wide receiver who caught six passes and a touchdown last week, showing his fantasy appeal and making him a hot waiver commodity. Minnesota, however, has its hands full in Week 5. Three of the Vikings' five starting offensive lineman are out due to injury, and they'll play a Browns defense that leads the NFL in rushing defense with 2.7 yards per carry. Already the clear second option to starter Jordan Mason, Scott's opportunity could be diminished if the patchwork Minnesota offensive line can't hold up against Cleveland."
rotoballer_205347,RB,Isaiah Davis,8,NYJ,CIN,11571,202510807,2025,2025-10-26 12:00 PM,2025-10-22 09:43 AM,Isaiah Davis Emerging as Potential Late-Season Sleeper,"New York Jets running back Isaiah Davis could quietly become a factor down the stretch of the 2025 season. So far, Davis has logged 10 carries for 44 yards and added nine receptions for 73 yards through the air. With Braelon Allen (knee) sidelined after undergoing surgery, Davis stepped in as the RB2, playing 39% of the snaps in his absence. Now, with trade rumors swirling around Breece Hall, Davis' role could expand even further. The winless Jets (0-7) may look to move Hall, who's in the final year of his contract. If that happens, Davis could find himself in line for a much larger workload. Even if New York brings in another back, Davis' fantasy value is on the rise. The Jets face the Cincinnati Bengals, who currently rank as the worst run defense in the NFL, making Week 8 a key opportunity to see how Davis performs with limited touches."
rotoballer_209979,RB,Jaylen Warren,14,PIT,BAL,8228,202511403,2025,2025-12-07 12:00 PM,2025-12-05 08:01 PM,Jaylen Warren a Rock-Solid RB2 Against Baltimore,"Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jaylen Warren has scored in two consecutive contests and will look to keep that momentum going in a Week 14 road matchup with the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens have been below average against the run this season, surrendering over 4.4 yards per carry and 11 rushing touchdowns. Baltimore has also struggled to contain pass-catching running backs, allowing the seventh-most targets, ninth-most receptions, and eighth-most receiving yards to the position. Warren hasn't been as consistently utilized through the air as he was early in the season, but he remains fully capable as a check-down option for quarterback Aaron Rodgers (wrist). Even with Kenneth Gainwell emerging as a reliable weapon for Pittsburgh, Warren is still the team's primary runner and preferred option on early downs. Fantasy managers should treat Warren as a solid RB2 heading into Sunday."
rotoballer_209783,RB,David Montgomery,14,DET,DAL,5892,202511411,2025,2025-12-04 07:15 PM,2025-12-03 08:42 PM,David Montgomery Remains a Touchdown-Dependent Flex Option in Week 14,"Detroit Lions running back David Montgomery recorded 48 scrimmage yards and a touchdown in Week 13, breaking his three-game scoreless streak. However, Montgomery earned just eight carries, marking the third straight game in which he's failed to reach double-digit rush attempts. In Week 14, Montgomery will square off against a Dallas Cowboys defense that has been playing much better against the run in recent weeks. Over their last three games, the Cowboys have allowed an average of just 69 rushing yards per contest. With the Lions leaning heavily on star running back Jahmyr Gibbs, Montgomery has played fewer than 39% of Detroit's offensive snaps in four of his last five games. As long as that workload split persists, Montgomery profiles as a touchdown-dependent flex option for fantasy managers."
rotoballer_207762,RB,Ollie Gordon,11,MIA,WAS,12495,202511119,2025,2025-11-16 08:30 AM,2025-11-14 09:04 PM,Ollie Gordon II Ready to Roll in Week 11,"Miami Dolphins running back Ollie Gordon II has been working through a knee injury and may have lost some playing time as a result. He has been limited in practice leading up to the Dolphins' Week 11 matchup against the Commanders in Madrid, but he does not have an injury designation this week. Last week, when he was listed as questionable, the rookie only played three snaps and had one carry, while Jaylen Wright played 10 snaps and had five carries. The two will continue to back up De'Von Achane, but since Achane is the focus of the offense, the work behind him is very limited. In Week 11, Gordon is the No. 52 RB in RotoBaller's rankings, leaving him buried on the bench or the waiver wire in all but the deepest formats."
rotoballer_211007,RB,Kimani Vidal,16,LAC,DAL,11647,202511609,2025,2025-12-21 12:00 PM,2025-12-15 04:47 PM,"Kimani Vidal's Volume Holds, But Production Remains a Question","Los Angeles Chargers running back Kimani Vidal led the backfield in snaps, routes, and two-minute offense in the team's 16-13 win over the Kansas City Chiefs, but struggled to produce efficiently, rushing 12 times for just 33 yards while being outgained per carry by Omarion Hampton. Vidal's value continues to come from his role rather than explosiveness, as he remains the preferred back on passing downs. The Chargers' focus on a ground-heavy approach keeps Vidal relevant in fantasy, but his weekly output stays unpredictable. In Week 16, the Cowboys present a mixed matchup, allowing rushing touchdowns at a high rate but limiting overall efficiency. Vidal is seen as a low-end RB2 or flex option, especially in PPR formats, though his ceiling is limited by sharing the backfield."
rotoballer_205854,RB,Dylan Sampson,10,CLE,NYJ,12469,202511024,2025,2025-11-09 12:00 PM,2025-10-27 11:40 AM,Dylan Sampson Trending Up After Injury to Fellow Rookie RB,"Cleveland Browns rookie running back Dylan Sampson is worth a look on the waiver wire in fantasy football this week after fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins (shoulder) was forced out of the Week 8 loss to the New England Patriots and did not return. Sampson ended up playing a season-high 46% of the offensive snaps while carrying the ball three times for no yards in the 32-13 blowout loss. However, the 21-year-old also caught five of his six targets in the passing game for 29 yards. Both Sampson and Ford should have bigger roles in Cleveland's backfield if Judkins misses additional time, but the fact that the Browns are going into their bye in Week 9 should make fantasy managers temper their waiver-wire bids for Sampson. Sampson's eight touches were the most he had seen since the regular-season opener. If Judkins isn't ready in Week 10 against the New York Jets, Sampson should lead the team's backfield."
rotoballer_205534,RB,Devin Neal,8,NO,TB,12476,202510822,2025,2025-10-26 03:05 PM,2025-10-24 03:15 PM,Devin Neal Expected To Take On Bigger Role,"New Orleans Saints rookie running back Devin Neal is expected to see more work after Kendre Miller's season-ending ACL injury. Neal will now slide in as the team's No. 2 running back behind veteran Alvin Kamara. The 2025 sixth-round pick from Kansas missed time in training camp with a hamstring injury, which set him back and allowed Miller to run away with the No. 2 running back duties. Neal suited up and played seven offensive snaps in Week 1, but then served as a healthy inactive for the next four weeks. The rookie again played only seven snaps on offense in Week 7 against the Bears, but caught the eyes of head coach Kellen Moore with an impressive rep in pass protection. Neal has been continually praised by his teammates for his intelligence, which bodes well for his chances of seeing more opportunities. He's a good player to stash as a handcuff in 12-team leagues."
rotoballer_208665,RB,Travis Etienne,12,JAX,ARI,7543,202511201,2025,2025-11-23 03:05 PM,2025-11-22 02:38 PM,"Travis Etienne Jr. Off the Injury Report, a High-End RB2 vs. Arizona","Jacksonville Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. (shoulder) was cleared from Friday's final injury report and will be active in Week 12 against the Arizona Cardinals. Etienne was a limited participant in practice this week due to a shoulder injury. The 26-year-old has been a borderline RB1 over the previous three weeks, scoring three touchdowns and getting over 16 carries a game during that stretch. Etienne is RotoBaller's 13th-ranked running back in Week 12 against a middle-of-the-pack Cardinals run defense. The Cardinals gave up 95 rushing yards and surrendered two rushing touchdowns last week to the San Francisco 49ers. Etienne will also have to split carries with rookie running back Bhayshul Tuten (ankle), who had a career high of 15 carries last week. To this point, Etienne has been able to fend off Tuten and be the RB1 in the Jaguars' backfield and will be a reliable high-end RB2 against a non-threatening Cardinals run defense."
rotoballer_207214,RB,Alvin Kamara,10,NO,CAR,4035,202511005,2025,2025-11-09 12:00 PM,2025-11-09 10:34 AM,Alvin Kamara Active for Week 10 Against Panthers,"New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara (ankle) is officially active for Sunday's Week 10 contest against the Carolina Panthers. He had been listed as questionable after practicing in a limited capacity. It's been a rough stretch of games for Kamara, who has just 12 carries over his last two games and is averaging just 2.7 yards per carry since Week 5. His usage and productivity in the receiving game have dwindled, too. However, he has a chance to bounce back in a favorable matchup against the Panthers. Fantasy managers should give him one more chance to produce as a low-end RB2 this week."
rotoballer_205391,RB,Alvin Kamara,8,NO,TB,4035,202510822,2025,2025-10-26 03:05 PM,2025-10-22 05:28 PM,Alvin Kamara Listed as Limited in Wednesday's Practice,"New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara (ankle) remains on the team's injury report heading into a Week 8 clash with the division-rival Tampa Bay Buccaneers this Sunday and was listed as limited in Wednesday's practice, according to Luke Johnson of the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Kamara was a DNP last Wednesday with his ankle injury, but he ended up returning to practice and was cleared from the final injury report. The 30-year-old five-time Pro Bowler ended up handling 11 carries for only 28 yards while catching all three of his targets for just one yard in the Week 7 loss to the Chicago Bears. However, Kamara did play a season-high 84% of the offensive snaps due to Kendre Miller (knee) suffering a torn ACL. Rookie Devin Neal will spell Kamara going forward. Kamara is still the Saints' lead back, but he's averaging a career-low 3.6 yards per carry and is showing signs of his age in his ninth NFL season."
rotoballer_204039,RB,Alvin Kamara,6,NO,NE,4035,202510622,2025,2025-10-12 12:00 PM,2025-10-09 03:18 PM,Alvin Kamara Back at Practice on Thursday,"New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara (ankle) was back at practice on Thursday after suffering an ankle injury during the team's practice on Wednesday, according to ESPN's Katherine Terrell. Kamara was officially listed on the Wednesday injury report as limited, but it appears he's trending towards being fine for the team's Week 6 matchup against the New England Patriots. Kamara has recorded 360 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown on 90 total touches through five games this season. If he were to miss any time, Saints running back Kendre Miller would likely dominate backfield touches in New Orleans. Assuming Kamara will be good to go on Sunday, he profiles as a low-end fantasy RB2 in Week 6 against New England. UPDATE: Kamara was limited in practice again on Thursday."
rotoballer_210747,RB,Keaton Mitchell,15,BAL,CIN,9511,202511507,2025,2025-12-14 12:00 PM,2025-12-13 10:50 AM,Keaton Mitchell a Risky Flex Play in Week 15,"Baltimore Ravens running back Keaton Mitchell briefly popped up on the injury report after registering a limited practice on Wednesday due to knee issues. Since then, he's been a full participant and was cleared from the injury report. Despite seeing 15% or less of the snap share in the last two weeks, Mitchell has finished as a high-end RB3 in half-PPR leagues. The last time against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 13, Mitchell found the end zone with two carries for 19 yards and two receptions for 12 yards. While he could have a similar game against the 32nd ranked defense against opposing backfields, he's a very risky flex play. He's currently projected as the RB55 in RotoBaller's rankings."
rotoballer_205858,RB,Tony Pollard,9,TEN,LAC,5967,202510934,2025,2025-11-02 12:00 PM,2025-10-27 01:15 PM,Tony Pollard Reportedly Available for Trade,"The Tennessee Titans have reportedly made running back Tony Pollard available in trade discussions after having already dealt away cornerbacks Jason Brownlee and Roger McCreary. The 28-year-old back has been workmanlike in his efforts this year, averaging just under four yards per carry on an offense that's had to fight for every inch. Pollard's contract runs through the 2026 season, but his dead cap for next year is only $2 million, and with him and 24-year-old Tyjae Spears seeing a near 50/50 split in recent weeks, he is clearly not a part of the Titans' long-term plans. With the NFL trade deadline just over a week away, some teams that have reportedly been in the running back market are the Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Chargers, and New England Patriots."
rotoballer_201384,RB,Aaron Jones,2,MIN,ATL,4199,202510220,2025,2025-09-14 07:20 PM,2025-09-12 04:31 PM,Aaron Jones Sr. A Viable Starter In Week 2,"Minnesota Vikings running back Aaron Jones Sr. is a high-end RB3/Flex candidate as his team takes on the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2. In its first game, Minnesota came up with a solid blueprint that the team is likely to try again, with the veteran earning the lion's share of the backfield receiving work and fellow running back Jordan Mason taking many of the tough running downs. From a fantasy perspective, Jones will get enough rushing work to pair nicely with his receiving ability to consider starting him, especially in PPR formats. The Vikings have shown they trust Jones in big passing situations, and with receiver Jordan Addison (suspension) still out, he's likely to earn at least a few key targets."
rotoballer_205628,RB,Jerome Ford,8,CLE,NE,8143,202510821,2025,2025-10-26 12:00 PM,2025-10-25 06:55 AM,Jerome Ford an RB4 in Week 8,"Cleveland Browns running back Jerome Ford has been filling a backup role behind Quinshon Judkins in 2025. Ford logged just one carry and caught two passes for 10 yards in a 31-6 win over the Miami Dolphins in Week 7. He will now head on the road to take on the New England Patriots in Week 8. The Patriots have been tough on running backs this season, allowing just the 27th-most fantasy points per game to the position. Ford isn't involved enough in the offense to trust in fantasy outside of using him as a desperation flex/RB4 heading into Week 8. He most likely should remain on fantasy benches on Sunday."
rotoballer_207873,RB,Blake Corum,11,LAR,SEA,11586,202511132,2025,2025-11-16 03:05 PM,2025-11-15 11:17 AM,Blake Corum's Role Not Enough to Overcome Tough Matchup?,"Los Angeles Rams running back Blake Corum has taken on an expanded role lately, registering at least 12 carries in each of his last three games. He played at least one-third of the offensive snaps in two of those three contests. He's also averaging 4.4 yards per carry over the last two weeks. Despite taking on an expanded workload in his role behind Kyren Williams, Corum could be headed for an underwhelming performance in Week 11, even if he continues to log double-digit touches. Corum is rarely ever involved in the passing game, relying on his rushing stats to anchor his fantasy performances. That could backfire on Sunday against the Seahawks, who have allowed the fewest rushing yards, third-fewest rushing touchdowns, and seventh-fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs in 2025. They've been much softer against pass-catching running backs, but that's more of a factor for Williams than Corum, given their respective roles. Against a tough defense, Corum remains a mere handcuff and can be left on the bench in fantasy football."
rotoballer_208278,RB,TreVeyon Henderson,12,NE,CIN,12529,202511207,2025,2025-11-23 12:00 PM,2025-11-19 04:29 PM,Patriots Non-Committal on TreVeyon Henderson's Week 12 Role,"New England Patriots rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson has played well in Rhamondre Stevenson's (toe) absence the last three games, averaging 5.6 yards per carry for 264 yards and four touchdowns on 47 rushing attempts. Henderson also caught 10 passes for 66 yards and another touchdown. However, head coach Mike Vrabel was non-committal when asked if there will be a more even workload between the two once Stevenson is back from his injury, according to Tom Carroll of WEEI. ""I think we'll probably have to have that conversation when it's certain that we're gonna have Rhamondre. He's gonna work through practice today, and we'll see where things go. TreVeyon's helped us, Rhamondre's helped us, Terrell [Jennings'] helped us."" Stevenson returned to a limited practice on Wednesday, but it's unclear if he'll play in Week 12 against the Bengals. Fantasy managers who have Henderson are surely hoping that the impressive rookie has done enough recently to warrant a bigger workload when Stevenson is back."
rotoballer_206455,RB,Jaret Patterson,9,LAC,TEN,7537,202510934,2025,2025-11-02 12:00 PM,2025-11-02 08:14 AM,Jaret Patterson Secures Backup Role Again in Week 9,"Los Angeles Chargers running back Jaret Patterson has been elevated to the active roster for Week 9 against the Tennessee Titans, which means he'll likely serve as the backup to Kimani Vidal once again. The Bolts have been forced to make plenty of running back moves this season with Najee Harris (Achilles), Omarion Hampton (ankle), and Hassan Haskins (hamstring) all on injured reserve. Vidal has played quite well as the de facto lead back, but having someone like Patterson for a change of pace is important. He played 21 percent of the snaps last week, rushing for 30 yards on 11 carries. We could see him handle a similar workload if the Chargers take an early lead on the Titans and pull some starters, but it probably won't be enough to get Patterson on the fantasy radar unless he scores a touchdown. Managers can continue to leave him on waivers in most leagues."
rotoballer_211307,RB,Tyrone Tracy,16,NYG,MIN,11655,202511623,2025,2025-12-21 12:00 PM,2025-12-19 08:16 AM,"Tyrone Tracy Jr. Earned a Majority of Giants Snaps in Week 15, Value on the Rise?","New York Giants second-year running back out of Purdue, Tyron Tracy Jr., piled up 97 total yards (70 rushing and 27 receiving) in Week 15 and punched in two touchdowns, good for 23.20 points in half PPR formats. Since the injury to Cam Skattebo (ankle) in Week 8, the backfield snaps have been relatively split between Tracy and Devin Singletary. However, in Week 15 we saw Tracy take a majority of the snaps for the first time since Skattebo's injury (76% compared to Singletary's 24%), and out touch him 19 to six, which is an excellent sign for Tracy fantasy managers as we head into the semi-finals of the fantasy football playoffs, as he now provides managers with the confidence to start him as an RB2/flex option against the Minnesota Vikings due to his projected opportunities. The Vikings have been middle-of-the-pack against opposing running backs, allowing the 15th fewest points to the position; however, given Tracy's projected volume after what he earned in Week 15, he can be started in most 12-team or larger formats."
