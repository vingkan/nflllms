{"title": "Saquon Barkley Looks to Overcome Denver Defense", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has failed to eclipse 50 rushing yards in each of his last two games, and will face another hurdle this Sunday against the Broncos. Denver is allowing 99.3 rushing yards per game this season-just one of 11 teams to average under 100. They also stifled Bengals RB Chase Brown on Monday, keeping him to 40 yards on 10 carries with his longest attempt going for six yards. However, Philly does have a much stronger offensive line than Cincinnati does, and Barkley averages more yards per carry (3.1) than Brown (2.3). Even with a couple things going against him, Barkley remains a definitive RB1 for Week 5.", "player_name": "Saquon Barkley", "week": 5, "team": "PHI", "opp": "DEN", "att": 6, "tgt": 3, "touches": 9, "actual": "low", "expect": "high", "reason": "opponent", "rushing_touchdowns": 0, "receiving_touchdowns": 1, "ppr_scoring_fantasy_points": 17, "ppr_scoring_position_rank": 11}
