    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, I analyzed 2,000 fantasy news reports about running backs from the 2025 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process boils down to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign reports to upcoming games\n",
    "2. Classify expected workload from reports\n",
    "3. Compare against actual workload\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "I sourced the player statistics and news reports from Sleeper and RotoBaller. The criteria for inclusion were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Player is an active running back or full back (can always add WRs and TEs later)\n",
    "2. Player only played on one team during the season (simplifies the process of matching news reports to games, only drops a few players)\n",
    "3. Report is after week one (too much volume and noise in reports before the season starts)\n",
    "4. Report is prospective, discussing expectations for next week, not just a recap of the previous week\n",
    "5. Player actually played in the game the week of the report\n",
    "6. Player also played in the game the week before the report\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, criteria 4 was easy to enforce because Sleeper and RotoBaller separate game recaps as \"analysis\" news. Choosing only the non-analysis reports led to the kind of reports aimed at fantasy managers trying to decide who to start and who to sit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whittled us down from over 5,000 potential reports to 2,040 reports. The final dataset covers 117 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "I randomly sampled 36 reports from that set and manually labeled them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each report is classified into both an expected workload level and a reason category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected workload level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High: more than 20 touches (carries + targets), usually the lead back\n",
    "- Medium: 10-20 touches, usually a split backfield\n",
    "- Low: less than 10 touches\n",
    "- Unknown: cannot be determined from the report\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason category:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance: the player is playing well, taking touches from a teammate who is playing worse, etc.\n",
    "- Injury: the player is injured, back from injury, their teammate was injured, etc.\n",
    "- Opponent: the team has a good or bad match up next week\n",
    "- Unknown: none of the above or cannot be determined\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually classifying the reports made me optimistic that a large language model could do the same. I used three of the manually-labeled reports as examples in the model prompt and the remaining 33 as a validation set to score different models. More details on this in the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I compared the expected workload level extracted from the report to the player's actual number of touches (carries + targets) in their next game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily, I used two metrics to analyze how well these report predict actual workload:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Precision: when the report suggests a certain workload level, how often is that workload level what actually happens?\n",
    "2. Recall: out of all the players who actually had a certain workload level, how many were expected by reports?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, there are far more players with low or medium workload than high workload. So it will be easiest to interpret the precision and recall scores if we break them out by each workload level."

Knight was once again the team's starting RB in last weekend's blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks, with Trey Benson (knee) still on Injured Reserve, but now his status is up in the air. The 24-year-old should be able to suit up, but his ankle injury could open the door for both Emari Demercado and Michael Carter to see more backfield touches. Knight had only 33 scrimmage yards on 11 touches before his ankle injury in Week 10, and he hasn't been very efficient since taking over in Arizona. Even when healthy, Knight's RB1 role hasn't been very secure, with Demercado seeing 14 carries in Week 9. If Knight is active, he'll be a pretty wishy-washy RB3/flex with limited upside for fantasy managers.\",\n",

On the ground, Jeanty handled a team-high 13 carries for 42 yards (3.2 yards per carry). The 21-year-old was able to bounce back coming out of the bye week after he had a season-low six carries for 21 yards and only one catch for 13 yards in the Week 7 blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. It's been slow going for Jeanty the last three games behind a shaky Raiders offensive line, and things won't get any easier on a short week on Thursday Night Football against a stout Denver Broncos defense in Week 10. Through his first eight NFL games, Jeanty has three rushing scores and three receiving touchdowns.\",\n",
