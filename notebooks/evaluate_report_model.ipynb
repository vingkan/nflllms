    "New York Giants running back Devin Singletary had 14 carries for 47 yards in Week 12's 34-27 loss in overtime to the Detroit Lions. While the 14 carries appear encouraging, the 3.36 YPC does not. Additionally, Tyrone Tracy Jr. played 71 percent of the snaps and out-touched Singletary 23 to 14. Additionally, Tracy Jr. continues to be a running back involved in the passing game and getting a majority of the carries, with Singletary being brought in as a goal-line or change-of-pace back. Given Singletary's 14 carries and the possibility of being the team's goal-line back, he is still worth a hold in fantasy, but not someone that can confidently be started unless we see a shift in snap percentage or Tracy were to go down with an injury. Week 13 presents a challenging task: going to Foxboro to take on New England's stiff run defense, which has allowed the fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs this season. Singletary will not be a recommended start in Week 13, but could be held on fantasy managers' bench if they have the spot available.\n",

    "Denver Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins delivered a solid performance in Week 3 despite his team's last-second 23-20 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Dobbins was effective on the ground, rushing for 83 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, including a 41-yard run that helped set up his score. He also recorded one catch for zero yards. After three games, Dobbins has been highly productive, averaging 5.4 yards per carry with over 220 rushing yards and three touchdowns. He seems to be secured as the lead back and is likely to continue seeing a significant workload as rookie R.J. Harvey struggles to find his rhythm. Dobbins can be viewed as a reliable RB2 option moving forward.\n",

    "Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said on Monday that running back Justice Hill (neck) will be out three to four weeks with a disc issue in his neck, but there's still a chance that he will return this year, according to Jonas Shaffer of The Baltimore Sun. Hill injured his neck in practice early last week and landed on Injured Reserve before the Thanksgiving Day loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday night. The 28-year-old pass-catching back will miss at least three more games, but he will be eligible to return from IR in Week 17 on the road at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers. Keaton Mitchell was starting to take on a bigger role behind starter Derrick Henry even before Hill was injured, so if he does return before the end of the 2025 regular season, Hill could be Baltimore's RB3 on passing downs. He only has 18 rushing attempts on the year for 93 yards and two TDs, adding 169 receiving yards and one score.\n",
