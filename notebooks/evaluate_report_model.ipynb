    "Mike DeFabo of The Athletic reported on Wednesday that Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers spoke highly of running back Jaylen Warren, saying that \"We might have to keep giving (Warren) him more opportunities in the pass game, because every time he touches it, something good happens.\" Warren has always been a solid fantasy asset in the passing game in his career, with 133 receptions in four NFL seasons; however, last Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, he was very productive through the air, hauling in all four of his targets for 86 yards, for a total of 134 all-purpose yards on 18 touches (14 on the ground and four through the air), This is an excellent sign for Warren fantasy owners, as rookie third round pick, Kaleb Johnson, does not appear to be getting any opportunities of the backfield. His only other competition for opportunities is Kenneth Gainwell, who went from a 54% snap share in Week 1 to a 42% snap share in Week 2. Warren should be considered a solid RB2 heading into Week 3 against the New England Patriots.\n",
